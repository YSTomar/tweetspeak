    <p>I started to follow Tweet Speak English as I was looking for a constant, interesting and well created flow of english bites. Something that I could follow everyday according to my busy schedule. TSE helps me in taking <strong>confidence with the spoken language</strong> shades, new informal expressions that you cannot learn in most of english classes.

    <p>TSE is practical and convenient - the lessons are fun and engaging. Each task is designed in bite-size; <b>allows you to learn at your own pace.</b> I also <em>LOVE</em> the feature where you can record yourself and get a feedback. It will help you ready for your next challenge in no time! Learning English naturally - I highly recommend it!
